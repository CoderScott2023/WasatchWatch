            <p>At Wasatch Watch, we use a maps graded by an index known as NDVI. In order to understand how to read an NDVI map, you must understand what NDVI is.</p>
            <p>NDVI, short for "normalized difference vegetation index" is an index that measures the relative greenness of an area. Essentially, how much vegetation cover there is in any one area of the plot relative to the rest of the plot. In this case, we use a relatively small-scale map of the Wasatch Front with 5 square km resolution (that is, each pixel you see in the graph is a 5 square km piece of land).</p>
            <p>NDVI is measured on a scale from 0-1, in this case. Where a value of 1 represents the most vegetated piece of land, typically synonymous for healthy and flourishing vegetation, while 0 is the least vegetated piece of land. This could be synonymous with unhealthy vegetation (although that would more likely take a value of .2-.3), but it is likely just an unvegetated piece of land. Something like a road or body of water.</p>
            <p>These graphs we label with the title "NDVI Gradient Map", and put the date in the file name. An example of an NDVI map is shown below:</p>

            <p>This is just one of two vegetation graphs we use, however. We also use a type of NDVI graph known as a difference graph. These difference graphs take the difference between the current month, and the month of comparison (typically the month of comparison will either be the previous month, or the same month in a different year). This shows a direct comparison of how the vegetation increased or decreased between the two time periods. A majority green difference graph means vegetation grew, while a majority red means vegetation was lost.</p>
            <p>These graphs are labelled with the title "NDVI Difference Map", along with the date of the current month and the month of comparison in that order. An example is shown below:</p>

            <p>One more thing to mention. Perhaps you have noticed the increase in vegetation over the Great Salt Lake in the mentioned distance map. However, obviously the Great Salt Lake did not grow vegetation on it (or at least, not to such a significant degree), however because NDVI is a relative index, it appears that way. When the baseline of vegetation is less vegetated than normal, the Great Salt Lake appears more vegetated relative to a map where the vegetation baseline is much higher, despite being the same throughout the year. This also shows up as an artifact in the difference maps.</p>
            <p>Using this knowledge, you can now read our NDVI maps and reports. Thank you for using Wasatch Watch!</p>
